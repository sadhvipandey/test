This is Compatible with Hacktoberfest 2023.


Hacktoberfest is an annual event run by GitHub that encourages developers to contribute to open source projects. The event runs throughout October, and developers can earn a digital badge by making four pull requests to participating open source repos.

Contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn and collaborate with other developers, and Hacktoberfest makes it a fun challenge to do so.

To participate, you'll first need to find a participating open-source project that you're interested in. This can be through searching on GitHub, or by checking out the official Hacktoberfest website for a list of participating repos.

Once you've found a project, the next step is to find an issue that you can contribute to. This might involve fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or writing documentation. The key is to find something that you are able to do and that would be helpful to the project.

After you've made your contributions, simply submit a pull request to the project!

Happy Hacktoberfest!
